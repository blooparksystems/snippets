==================

This is how it works:

This snippet is based on a Codrops article by Mary Lou http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/07/30/fullscreen-form-interface/. Build for a fullscreen form and adapted for users to create a project inquiry, the form has questions such as expectations for the website, budget, and so on. The form will create a lead in the backend.


Installation:
-------------
Just download the complete module and add it to your v8.0 addons folder. After restarting the server, update your module list and install the snippet.
The module is dependent to the CRM, it will be installed automatically but if something is wrong, check if it is installed correctly. It will be then available in your snippet toolbar of the website builder.

Notes
-----
This addon is based on Codrops Fullscreen interface, will work on modern browsers with HTML5 and has been developed and tested for Odoo v8.0. The screenshot shows the snippet with our custom Bloopark theme. It might look different if you have another theme installed. The styling is done in Less and compiled with Grunt. If you need help styling the snippet to your own needs please don't hesitate to contact us.
